# Express Challenge

✓ using the start point - install the required node packages

✓ in index.html add three new elements: an input for ID, a button for 'GET One', and a div to output the data

✓ add these three elements to the dom.js file

✓ in script.js add a function to read just one item from the database (you will need to pass in an ID)

✓ remember that to start the app from the command line you can run 'npm start' and to stop it you can use the shortcut ctrl+c

✓ test that the new functionality works on the front end by opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 while the app is running

* in the app.js create a function to update an item (it will need to take in an ID)

* use curl to update an item from the command line. You will need to restart the server to do this (and create an item to update)

* in the app.js create a function to delete an item (it will need to take in an ID)

* use curl to delete an item from the command line. You will need to restart the server to do this (and create an item to update)

* You now have an application that can CRUD!

* add a .gitignore to ignore the node_modules folder

* upload your work to github

## Bonus

* finish building the front-end by including a way to update and delete items
