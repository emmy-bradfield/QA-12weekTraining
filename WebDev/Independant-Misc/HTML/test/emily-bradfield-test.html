    <h2> For testing using html to code a webpage</h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<body> 
    <p>So far, from what I have seen of HMTL code already, as well as a quick scim over an intro on a
    training website, I have established how to create both a title for the page (which I then saw from
    opening the website actually appears as the page title not as text on the page) and some body text.
    Seeing title didn't do what I thought, this was when I actually did my first quick Google and saw
    that the h1 through h6 actually create headings, with h1 being highest and h6 the lowest level. I 
    also then discovered the p for paragraph option. </p>
    <p> This is when I actually added the headings and paragraph tools, and decided to change the page 
    from the previous assortment of random test information to this body text, essencially creating 
    a hmtl webpage which will show my journey from very first lines of code to very last. The very 
    first version of this (where it was just body text stating "This is my test page") will not exist
    anymore, however even though it may mean it looks awful, I intend to simply add to this page as 
    I learn rather than overwriting previous, inexperienced bits of the page. The idea is there should
    be a (rather funny looking) timeline where as you scroll the page itself becomes more interesting 
    and advanced. So now, we begin... </p>
    <h3> Adding a Link </h3>
    <p> You can add links to your html document using the 'a' command, followed by 'href=' and the link you want 
    to add, then close the angle-bracket, add the text for the link to display, then finish with the 'a/' in the 
    angle brackets as usual, like so: </p>

    <h3> The Pre Function </h3>
<pre>   Here I am using the pre function to inform the code that the text in this section is pre-formatted. What 
this means is that the indents, line breaks, and font which I am typing the code with will in fact be kept
and so the html document text will look identical to the text that I wrote when coding it. Notice how it does
look different to the text above? That is because I have added line breaks based on VSCode's display size,
and the font is the same font as that which is used in VSCode. Neat, huh?
</pre>
<h3> Formatting Text </h3>
<p> It would be nice if the text looked nicer... I wonder how hard it is? </p>
<h4 style="font-family:arial;color:indigo;text-align:center;margin:auto;"> It's Actually PRETTY Easy...</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-style:italic;text-align:justify"> And yes, that pun was indeed very much 
intended. Formatting can also be applied to just a small section, or <strong><i>specific </i></strong> words withing
the chunk of test. This can even be <em> emphasised </em>, <mark>marked</mark>, <small>small</small>, <del>
    deleted</del>, <ins>inserted</ins>, <sub>subscript</sub>, or <sup>superscript</sup>... such fun!</p>
<p> Also, I have to say, I am relying a lot on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3 School's HTML Guide
</a> to be able to guide me on this. Whoop, go them! :) </p>
