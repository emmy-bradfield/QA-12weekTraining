I want you to make for me a casino themed webpage. 

Blackjack - Oneplayer. User starts the game, and draws one card
After this the user can choose whether to draw or fold.
Once the player has lost (gone above 21) they can no longer play the game

Second Player - Choose a random card and when the player is ready to Fold or go Bust
Then the Second players result is unveiled
