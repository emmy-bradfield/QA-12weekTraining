        <br>
        <p>Here I explore and practice learning and understanding HTML, CSS, and JS through my course with HTML. Whilst
            specific documentation, work, and practice will be organised in their respective folders and not in the same
            directory, this website exists for me to practice bringing the various elements together and building the
            website up as I go <br> </p>

        <h2> Part One: Exploring CSS and BootStrap </h2>
        <p>The basics of HTML have been discussed and covered prior, and so the first section focuses on the use of
            CSS and bootstrapping. The following is a collection of code snippets which are designed to explore the
            implementation of various styles, as well as solving various CSS-based problems as set by QA. Each task will
            include a brief summary of it's purpose and the code provided, and the solution will be displayed on the
            webpage
            itself. </p>
