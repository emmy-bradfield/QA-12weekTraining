        <br>
        <p>Here I explore and practice learning and understanding HTML, CSS, and JS through my course with HTML. Whilst
            specific documentation, work, and practice will be organised in their respective folders and not in the same
            directory, this website exists for me to practice bringing the various elements together and building the
            website up as I go <br> </p>
