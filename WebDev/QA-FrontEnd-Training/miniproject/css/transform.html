        <br>
        <p>Here I explore and practice learning and understanding HTML, CSS, and JS through my course with HTML. Whilst
            specific documentation, work, and practice will be organised in their respective folders and not in the same
            directory, this website exists for me to practice bringing the various elements together and building the
            website up as I go <br> </p>

    <h2> Compare the two images below and apply the relevent transformations to achieve the output below</h2>
    <div>
        <p> The image below is identical to the one provided, and the output image is the same but rotated 45 degrees.</p>
        <img class="embed" src="../assets/task1.png"
            alt="an image of a sailor and a boy, the sailor is pointing forwards">
        <p> Firstly, I begin by placing the image as in the original into the body of the HTML page (see above).
            Next, I then need to insert a second copy of the image, but this time using the transform property to rotate
            it
            about 45 degrees. Below, I will insert the rotated image as well as a snipet of the code that I used. </p>
            <img class="left" src="../assets/task1.png" alt="the same image as above, but rotated 45 degrees">
        <img class="right" src="../assets/task1-solution1.png"
            alt="a screenshot of code showing the left class used on the image">
        <p class="caption"> The above image shows a screenshot of some code. You can see the image has been inserted and
            the class set as left.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="right" src="../assets/task1-solution2.png"
            alt="a screenshot of code showing the css definition for left class">
        <p class="caption"> This image then shows the CSS code for styling items of class left, using the rotate feature
            and
            specifying 45deg to rotate the image. </p>
